## Three things I liked about IO
- I Do
- Not Like
- This Language
- (jokes aside when it comes to three things I liked... well I didn't I really struggled with this one, and probably should have got help but I thought I could handle it)

## Most important Rescource
- https://iolanguage.org/
- it was the only real place to get good information although the io programming wiki was able to tell me a little bit as well

## additional notes
- I know my program doesn't work when you try to run it, none of my methods in feline or canine work and I don't know how to fix it, as far as I can tell they should but just don't, but im already 2 days late trying to get this working and im out of time, so im just going for any partial credit I might be able to get
